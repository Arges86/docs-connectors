= Amazon SQS Studio Configuration - Mule 4
:page-aliases: connectors::amazon/amazon-sqs-connector-studio.adoc

To configure a connector in Anypoint Studio:

. Install the connector.
. Configure an input source for the connector.
. Configure the connector.

== Install the Connector

Installing the connector adds it to a Studio project. Anypoint Studio provides two ways to install a connector:

* Use the Exchange application in the Studio taskbar.

* Use the Exchange icon in the Mule Palette view.

=== Install the Connector from the Studio Taskbar

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. Click the Exchange icon *(X)* in the upper left of the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. In Exchange, search for `Amazon SQS`.
. Select *Amazon SQS*.
. Click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

=== Install the Connector from the Mule Palette View

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the Mule Palette view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Modules to Project*, type `Amazon SQS` in the search field.
. Click the connector name in *Available modules*.
. Click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Configure an Input Source

An input source initiates a flow when a specified condition is met. You can configure one of these input sources to use with Amazon SQS Connector:

* *Receive Messages*, source which listens for Amazon SQS messages.
* *HTTP Listener*, which initiates a flow each time it receives a request on the configured host and port.
* *Scheduler*, which initiates a flow when a time-based condition is met.

---
**NOTE**

**Receive Messages** source has *Primary node only* parameter placed in the *Advanced tab*. The default value of this parameter is set to false, what ensures that this source can be deployed to recevie messages on multiple nodes when running in cluster mode. When the application is designed to receive messages on primary node only, change this value to true by checking the **Primary node only** checkbox. The multi node cluster behavior is highly dependent on the SQS queue type selected. When using the Standard queue, SQS guarantees that a message is delivered at least once but duplicate messages can be introduced in the queue. Otherwise a FIFO queue can be used to ensure that a message is delivered exactly once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it. Duplicate messages are not introduced in this type of queue.

== Configure the Connector

To use Amazon SQS Connector in your Mule application, configure a global element that can be used by all Amazon SQS Connectors in the application.

. Drag a connector operation onto the Studio canvas.
. To create a global element for the connector, click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas, and then click *Create*.
. In the *Choose Global Type* window, expand *Connector Configuration* and select *Amazon SQS Configuration*:
+
image::amazon-sqs-studio-select-global.png[Select Connector for Global Element]
+
. Click *OK*.
. Specify the global element properties.
+
You can either enter your credentials into the global configuration properties or reference a configuration placed in a file in the `src` folder of your project file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better reuse of your project, use a configuration file:
+
image::amazon-sqs-studio-global-config-new.png[Configure Global Element]
+
. Configure the parameters as follows:
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|Name | Name used to reference the configuration
|Session Token | Session token used to validate the temporary security credentials
|Access Key |Alphanumeric text string that uniquely identifies the user who owns the account
|Secret Key |Key that acts as a password
|Try AWS Credentials Provider Chain|Drop-down menu that controls whether temporary credentials should be used
|Region Endpoint |Regional endpoint to process your requests
|Default Global URL |URL of the Amazon SQS queue to act upon
|===
+
When you provide a queue URL in the *Default Global Queue URL* field of the global element, the connector automatically creates the queue and sets the URL of this queue as the provided value. All Amazon SQS message processors that reference the global element perform operations using this queue URL.
+
To reference a different queue URL for a particular message processor in the flow, perform the operation using the `Queue URL` attribute provided by the message processor.
. Leave the default entries for the *Proxy* and *Advanced* tabs.
. Click *Test Connection* to confirm that the parameters of your global configuration are accurate and that Mule is able to connect successfully to your instance of Amazon SQS.
. Click *OK*.

== Next Step

After configuring this connector in Studio, see the
