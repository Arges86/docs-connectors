== Changes in This Release

* Version 5.5.0 was deprecated because cluster mode support was accidentally removed. The behavior used for running the application on single or multiple nodes was added back to the connector and now it runs on all cluster nodes by default. When upgrading from version 5.5.0 to version 5.6.0 be aware of defaulty selected option where the application runs on all cluster nodes.

== Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following requirements before you perform the upgrade:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule |4.1.1 and later
|Java|1.8.0_x
|Anypoint Studio|7.0 and later
|===

See the xref:release-notes::connector/amazon-sqs-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[Amazon SQS Connector Release Notes] for updated compatibility information for patch updates.

== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you upgrade, create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `Amazon SQS` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select *Amazon SQS Connector* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `mule-amazon-sqs-connector` dependency version is 5.6.0 in the `pom.xml` file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.

== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project `pom.xml` file.
. When the application contains *Receive Message* source, verify the *Primary node only* parameter and select whether application should run on single or multiple nodes.
. Test the connection and verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

If there are problems with caching the parameters and metadata, try restarting Studio.

== Revert the Upgrade

If you must revert to your previous version of Amazon SQS Connector, change the `mule-amazon-sqs-connector` dependency version 5.6.0 in the projectâ€™s `pom.xml` to the latest version which is not deprecated - 5.4.3.
