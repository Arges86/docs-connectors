== Operations

[[Execute]]
== Execute

Run a script with provided code, according to the engine and passing parameters. The script provides many bindings variables to work with:

[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^80%", options="header"]
|===
| Name              | Type                  | Description
| payload            | Object                | The payload of the message processed.
| dataType           |                       | Data type of the message payload.
| correlationId      | String                | The correlationId of the message processed.
| attributes         | Map<String, Object>   | Attributes of the Mule message processed.
| vars               | Map<String, Object>   | The variables set on the current Mule event processed.
| message            |                       | The message processed.
| error              |                       | Error associated with the Mule message processed.
| authentication     |                       | Information about the authentication.
| flow               | String                | The name of the current flow.
| log                | Logger                | Logger object that logs to the app's log file, `MULE_HOME/logs/<app-name>.log`
| result             | Object                | Variable representing the result of the script execution.
| registry | org.mule.runtime.api.artifact.Registry | Use the registry object to access any other service within the Mule API.
|===

Note that if the code doesn't produce an implicit result, you have to set the variable explicitly with the execution result. The payload is set with this value unless you configure a xref:mule-runtime::target-variables.adoc[Target Variable] as described in xref:scripting/scripting-module.adoc[Scripting Module] documentation.


==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Code a| String |  The script source code to execute |  |x
| Engine a| String |  Name of the scripting engine for running this script |  |x
| Parameters a| Map<String, Object> |  Variables provided to the script as bindings |  |
| Target Variable a| String |  The name of a variable on which the operation's output is placed |  |
| Target Value a| String |  An expression that is evaluated against the operation's output and the outcome of that expression is stored in the target variable |  #[payload] |
|===

IMPORTANT: The classes used with the Scripting Module must be exported, otherwise, the execution fails with a `SCRIPTING:COMPILATION` error. See xref:mule-runtime::how-to-export-resources.adoc[How to export resources].

==== Throws

* SCRIPTING:COMPILATION
* SCRIPTING:UNKNOWN_ENGINE
* SCRIPTING:EXECUTION
