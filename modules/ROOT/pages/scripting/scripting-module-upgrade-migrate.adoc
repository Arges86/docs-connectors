== Changes in This Release

This release contains the following changes:

* Scripting Module no longer provides default scripting engines. +
User must specify the desired engine in the project´s `pom.xml` file.
* Added a helper to make easier the engine installation.
* For any stream provided in the payload or vars, a cursor opens and binds, preventing the user from the need to open new cursors.
* Any open cursor provided to the Scripting Module closes after the script execution.


== Upgrade Prerequisites

Before you perform the upgrade, you must complete the following:

* Create a backup of your files, data, and configurations in case you need to restore to them.

== Upgrade Steps

Follow these steps to perform the upgrade:

. In Anypoint Studio, create a Mule project.
. In *Mule Palette*, click *Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter  in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, select `Scripting Module` and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.
. Verify that the `mule-scripting-module` dependency version is `2.0.0 in` the  file in the Mule project.

Studio upgrades the connector automatically.


== Post Upgrade Steps

After you install the latest version of the connector, follow these steps to complete the upgrade by adding a `jsr-223` compliant scripting engine:

. Search the engine by name using the helper.
. Add the engine `GAV` in the application´s `pom.xml` file.
. Press refresh button.
. Select the engine in the execute configuration.

=== Verify the Upgrade

After you install the latest version of the connector, verify the upgrade:

. In Studio, verify that there are no errors in the *Problems* or *Console* views.
. Verify that there are no problems in the project  file.
. Test the connection to verify that the operations work.

== Troubleshooting

Jython does not work in the new Scripting Module version. If Jython is required, use the standalone version.
For additional information, see xref:scripting-module-xml-maven.adoc[Scripting Module XML and Maven Support].
