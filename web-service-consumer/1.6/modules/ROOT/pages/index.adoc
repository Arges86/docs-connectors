Web Service Consumer Connector Version 1.6

Anypoint Connector for Web Service Consumer (Web Service Consumer Connector) consumes a SOAP Web service
to acquire data from an external source. In many cases, you can use an existing MuleSoft connector, such as Workday or ServiceNow, to connect to a service provider. When no connector is available for a specific Web service, the easiest way to consume the service from a Mule app is to use the Web Service Consumer Connector.

The main features of this connector include:

* Consuming DOC Literal Web services.
* SOAP multipart messages.
* SOAP Headers.
* DataSense support for SOAP Headers, SOAP Body, and Attachment.
* Embedded DataWeave transformations inside the operation.
* Support and Unified experience for SOAP with attachments and MTOM handling.
* Custom HTTP configuration as transport (runtime and design time).
* Web Service Security (WS Security) support.

NOTE: RPC WSDLs are not supported by the Web Service Consumer.
